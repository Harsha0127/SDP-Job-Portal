These portals offer a wide range of services, including job listings, resume posting, job application submissions, and employer recruitment tools. Job seekers can browse through various job opportunities posted by companies across different industries and geographic locations, apply for positions online, and manage their job applications. On the other hand, employers can post job vacancies, search for qualified candidates, and manage the recruitment process efficiently through features like applicant tracking systems and candidate screening tools.
