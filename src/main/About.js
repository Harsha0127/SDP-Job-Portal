      <h2>Job Listings</h2>
      <p>One of the primary features of an online job portal is the extensive database of job listings from various industries, companies, and locations. Job seekers can browse through these listings to find relevant job opportunities based on their skills, experience, and preferences.</p>
      <h2>Resume Posting</h2>
      <p>Job seekers can create and upload their resumes to the online job portal, making it easier for employers to find and review their qualifications and experience. Some portals offer tools for building and formatting resumes to attract more attention from potential employers.</p>
      <h2>Job Search Filters</h2>
      <p>To help job seekers narrow down their search and find the most relevant job listings, online job portals often include search filters such as location, industry, job title, salary range, and more. These filters make it easier for job seekers to find the jobs that best match their criteria.</p>
      <h2>Application Submission</h2>
      <p> Once job seekers find job listings of interest, they can easily apply for these positions through the online job portal. Portals typically provide an online application form or allow applicants to upload their resumes and cover letters directly to the job listing.</p>
      <h2>Employer Accounts</h2>
      <p>Employers can create accounts on online job portals to post job listings, manage applications, and access other recruitment tools. Employer accounts may include features such as applicant tracking systems (ATS), which help employers organize and manage candidate profiles, schedule interviews, and communicate with applicants.</p>
